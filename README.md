# UnityImageAreaSelection
The player of your game shall be able to extract a selection of the currently rendered camera image? This assethe t will assist you in implementing this feature.

This asset:
- right now just works for orthografic cameras, because it was initially implemented to get an extracted selection of a two dimensional image like the background or the current camera picture.
- is implemented to work independent from the plattform (mobile devices as well as PCs are supported).
- is based on the Unity3d UI system.
